It's possible I don't do animals either.
For example it could be like elf people, which maybe that's more generic but what if they all kinda were like humans crossed with rams
	- essentially tieflings?

Ideas on how to de-furry the characters:
	Use Unique Art Styles
	Move away from cartoonish or "cuddly" aesthetics commonly seen in furry designs.
	Stylized abstraction: Incorporate surrealist or minimalist art styles to reinterpret animal features (e.g., elongated shapes, angular designs, or cubist inspiration).
	Cultural influences: Take inspiration from indigenous art, ancient mythology, or folklore traditions to reframe how you present these animals.
	!! Uncanny aesthetics: Play with unsettling or unexpected traits (e.g., glowing eyes, broken symmetry, or animal traits blended with mechanical parts).
	
	Minimal clothing: Focus on adornments like armor, capes, tribal markings, jewelry, or tools rather than full outfits.
	Integrated clothing: Design outfits that feel like extensions of their biology (e.g., a fox-like character with fur patterns resembling ceremonial robes).
	
	kitsune (multi-tailed foxes)
	
	Occupation-based designs: Make characters blacksmiths, alchemists, wanderers, or healers and reflect these roles in their accessories or tools.
	
	!! Urban or dystopian world-building: Blend animal traits with cyberpunk or industrial elements, such as a squirrel-inspired character with mechanical limbs scavenging a ruined city.
	
	Textural variety: Emphasize fur patterns, scales, or other textures in a painterly or abstract way.
	
	!! Use muted tones, gradients, or monochromatic schemes for a more mature, artistic vibe.
	
	Non-realistic shapes: Break traditional anatomical rules. For example:
		Oversized deer antlers resembling fractals.
		A fox character with swirling, flame-like tails.
	
	Combine animal traits with mechanical or otherworldly elements:
		A fox with clockwork components instead of fur.
		A wolf with bark-like skin and glowing eyes as though it's part of the forest.
		A deer that is part skeletal with crystalline antlers.
	
	
	Decrease human traits:
		Replace human hands with paw-like structures, claws, or more alien appendages.
		
		Avoid giving them a human face. Opt for more animalistic snouts, elongated jaws, or hybridized features.
			While they may have animalistic features (e.g., snouts, large ears), furry designs often use expressive, human-like facial proportions (large eyes, eyebrows, etc.) to make the characters more relatable.
		
		Make their stance animalistic (e.g., digitigrade legs or crouched posture) rather than upright.
			Most furry designs feature fully upright, bipedal stances, giving them distinctly human-like proportions.
			!! Maybe some characters can be
				- sitting on their tail like a squirrel
				- crouched versus standing
